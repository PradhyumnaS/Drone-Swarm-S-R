# Autonomous Drone-Swarm Search and Rescue using RL

- Developed a multi-agent reinforcement learning model using PPO to optimize drone swarm behavior in search-
and-rescue missions, focusing on dynamic exploration and battery-efficient strategies.
- Engineered adaptive reward functions and state-space management techniques to enhance coordination and
efficiency in complex, obstacle-laden environments.
